Hi,
Greetings to you.
 
Hi,
I am Kiby George, former manager with (Atlantic Bank Group Togo) presently the current Manager at a Branch with the Barclays Bank -UK. Truth is that i have never met you before in person but that's by the way.
I need a reliable and an honest person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.
 
 
A foreigner (LATE ENGR DONAK SAMU BLEON ) oil Merchant /contractor with some companies in TOGO, before his death some years ago in a ghastly author crash deposited with Atlantic Bank Group Togo a closing balance of USD$15.5M: which, I successfully moved the money in a security vault Safe Keeping with Barclays Bank -UK with instruction that it MUST be Delivered to the BENEFICIARY [YOU].
 
 
Furthermore I personally moved the money to Barclays Bank -UK when I was called to become the manager. However the bank expects the money to be claimed by the beneficiary as instructed.
Though valuable efforts were been made to get in touch with any of late Engr’s relative or next of kin, though (he did not make any person known to me) or the Bank.
 
Now the board of directors is making arrangement for the fund to be declared “UNCLIAMABLE” and then subsequently becomes Bank’s money. In order to avert this negative development, that is why, I seek for your permission to PRESENT YOU as the through next of kin so that the fund, USD$15.5M, would subsequently paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin.
 
 
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount. While the rest 60% would be for me which I can invest in your country and 10% for the expenses. Kindly get back to me immediately via e-mail (thisiskibygeorge@gmail.com) for relevant details.
 
 
Mr.Kiby George,
Barclays Bank -UK
